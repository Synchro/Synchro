### Hi there. I'm Marcus Bointon.

When I'm not skiing, I'm writing & pentesting for [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com/), working on [smartmessages.net](https://info.smartmessages.net/) (*the* privacy-first email marketing service), and supporting [1CRM](https://www.syniah.com/). I'm the maintainer of [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer), probably the world's most popular email sending code. I've also answered [over a thousand questions about PHPMailer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:333340+[phpmailer]). I'm a contributor to many other open-source projects, and I wrote [the HTML5 email address specification](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#e-mail-state-(type=email)). I'm a co-developer of [chamsocial.com](https://chamsocial.com/) a local private social network in Chamonix, France. I'm an accomplished PHP & Laravel developer, Linux sysadmin, technical writer/editor, and MySQL DBA. I'm a strong advocate of digital rights and privacy – I love GDPR! I've been speaking and running workshops at technical conferences around the world since 2006, mainly on security, privacy, and email. I live in the French 🇫🇷 alps 🏔 with my wife 👩🏻, kids 👦🏼👧🏻, cat 🐱, guitars 🎸, bikes 🚵, and far too many skis 🎿.

If my code or answers have helped you, please [**sponsor me on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/Synchro), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/marcusbointon), or [get your company to sponsor Open Source on TideLift](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-phpmailer-phpmailer?utm_source=packagist-phpmailer-phpmailer&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo).

Buy my book ["The HTTP/3 book"](https://leanpub.com/thehttp3book)! I'm currently writing a bigger book on HTTP/3 and QUIC for APress.

I write [songs about web development](https://marcus.bointon.com/music) (yes, really!), like about Laravel, Tailwind, Blue Teams, Pair Programming, meeting nice people at conferences, and other things, which you can, read about, listen to and buy from my site.
